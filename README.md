# Shaders on the Wii U

This is intended to be a quick introduction for writing shaders in assembly and assembling them with latte-assembler.  
This is not complete at all. If you have any questions feel free to contact me on Discord (Gary#4139)!

Start reading [here](shaders.md)!

## TODO
- Add info about how to use these shaders with GX2
- Add more detailed information about instructions and types
- Add section about textures
- Add section about uniforms
- Add section about loops
- Add section about arrays
- How to use multiple ALUs
